            <h2>ONE PEICE</h2>
            <p>
                According to the leaks, chapter 1044 of One Piece is titled “Liberation Winner.” Of course, Kaidou declares that Luffy is dead; however, Sanji, Zoro, and other allies can feel the presence of their captain.

After that, we see the conversation of Gorousei in the castle of Mary Geosi. Apparently, the World Government has always tried to “Gomu Gomu No Mi,” but they only failed in that mission. That’s maybe because “Akuma no Mi” ran away from them. According to the Gorousei, Gomu Gomu No Mi’s real name is “Hito Hito no Mi, and it’s a Zoan-type fruit. Interestingly, these types of fruits have a mind of their own.

On the other hand, Luffy has awakened his fruit, and it’s his final stage or “Gear 5.” Now, Luffy again starts fighting Kaidou, and he takes Kaido to the rooftop by grabbing him. He then touches the ground to turn it into rubber and attacks Kaido with all his might.

Of course, these spoilers may not be completely accurate, so make sure to read the full chapter when it arrives this week
